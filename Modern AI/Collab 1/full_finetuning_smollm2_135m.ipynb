        "### What We Did:\n",
        "1. ✅ Loaded SmolLM2-135M model (135 million parameters)\n",
        "2. ✅ Configured for **FULL fine-tuning** (r=0, all parameters updated)\n",
        "3. ✅ Prepared a small instruction-following dataset (100 examples)\n",
        "4. ✅ Fine-tuned the model for 60 steps\n",
        "5. ✅ Tested the model with various prompts\n",
        "6. ✅ Saved the fine-tuned model\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences from LoRA:\n",
        "- **Full Fine-tuning**: Updates ALL 135M parameters\n",
        "- **LoRA**: Would only update a small number of adapter parameters\n",
        "- **Memory**: Full fine-tuning uses more memory\n",
        "- **Performance**: Can achieve better task-specific performance\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "1. Record a YouTube video walkthrough of this notebook\n",
        "2. Explain each step, the input format, and outputs\n",
        "3. Upload the video and this successfully run notebook\n",
        "4. Move to Colab 2 for LoRA fine-tuning comparison\n",
