        "3. ✅ Applied LoRA for efficient training\n",
        "4. ✅ Trained with DPO to prefer helpful responses\n",
        "5. ✅ Tested alignment with safety/helpfulness prompts\n",
        "6. ✅ Saved DPO-aligned model\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways:\n",
        "- **DPO** directly optimizes preferences without a reward model\n",
        "- **Beta parameter** (0.1) controls preference strength\n",
        "- **Helpful & Harmless** are key alignment goals\n",
        "- Model now prefers better responses over worse ones\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "- Try with larger datasets (10K+ pairs)\n",
        "- Experiment with beta values (0.05-0.5)\n",
        "- Test on your own preference pairs\n",
        "- Deploy for real-world applications\n",
