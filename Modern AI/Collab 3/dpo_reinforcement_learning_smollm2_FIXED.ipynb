    "- DPO is a reinforcement learning method for aligning LLMs with human preferences\n",
    "- Uses pairs of **preferred** (good) and **rejected** (bad) outputs\n",
    "- Simpler than PPO (no reward model needed)\n",
    "- Directly optimizes the policy to prefer better responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Details\n",
    "- **Model**: SmolLM2-135M-Instruct\n",
    "- **Method**: DPO with LoRA (r=16)\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Did:\n",
    "1. ✅ Loaded Anthropic HH-RLHF preference dataset\n",
    "2. ✅ Prepared chosen vs rejected response pairs\n",
    "3. ✅ Applied LoRA for efficient training\n",
    "4. ✅ Trained with DPO to prefer helpful responses\n",
    "5. ✅ Tested alignment with safety/helpfulness prompts\n",
    "6. ✅ Saved DPO-aligned model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- **DPO** directly optimizes preferences without a reward model\n",
    "- **Beta parameter** (0.1) controls preference strength\n",
    "- **Helpful & Harmless** are key alignment goals\n",
    "- Model now prefers better responses over worse ones\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Try with larger datasets (10K+ pairs)\n",
    "- Experiment with beta values (0.05-0.5)\n",
    "- Test on your own preference pairs\n",
    "- Deploy for real-world applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Congratulations!** You've successfully trained a preference-aligned model with DPO! 🎉"
